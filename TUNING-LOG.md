# ChessLosebot tuning log — the model era

Running lab notebook for the post-pivot architecture (the `losebot/`
package: urge-family opponent models, expectimax steering, the
opponent-free oracle, and the frozen league). One entry per session or
review round; every performance claim cites a league report under
`games/league/`.

The specialist era's complete notebook (2026-07-12 through the pivot:
eval tuning, herding VI, king-holder templates, the donation guard,
every drill battery and live-game postmortem) lives with its code at
`specialists/TUNING-LOG.md`. Its commands predate the rename and read
`pypy3 -m losebot ...`; substitute `-m specialists`.

## The pivot: one opponent family, expectimax steering, oracle closing (2026-07-21)

Decision, taken with two concurring outside opinions on the same
evidence: the specialist line stays frozen as teacher and anchor, and
primary development moves to a model-based architecture. The evidence
that forced it, all first-party: case-9/10 convert 10/10 vs the squat
kernel and 0/10 vs sloppy FROM THE SAME CORNER; the two kernels demand
opposite doctrines (early lift vs. plug hold) and the session-19 fix
round concluded "no position predicate discriminates"; YBZEWDGj's one
two-move fork beat 497 donation-guard vetoes because model=zach search
explores no capturing reply at any depth; six live games produced zero
forced mates (both landed mates were human cooperation); and the drill
EVs vs Zach have sat at their audited structural caps (vacate coin at
1/2-3/4) since 07-17 while each live game bought 2-3 new kernel-scoped
exposures at a session of machinery apiece. The economics inverted:
cost per exposure rising, transfer per fix ~zero. The fix is not a
bigger doctrine stack and not tabula-rasa self-play RL either (misère
equilibrium is a mutual-strip draw; self-play never observes the
error distribution that makes weak opponents beatable). It is: put the
opponent's policy DISTRIBUTION in the tree, and make certificates
opponent-free.

What landed (package `losebot/`, the old engine renamed intact to
`specialists/` — its selftest passed through the rename untouched):

- `models/`: the URGE FAMILY — one parametric stochastic opponent
  (mate-avoidant core; urges: mercy lapse, promote, greed+trade with
  the push-and-scan recapture adjudication, check, push, hunt, corner
  homing, pawn-hostage shuffle) exposing EXACT per-move distributions.
  Zach = all-zeros, session-19 sloppy = one point, the corner squatter
  = home 1.0 + pawn_last. New behavior updates parameters, not code.
- `oracle.py`: the exact forced-selfmate probe, ported adversarial-only
  (Zach-modeled probes remain a specialist tool). Repetition-era
  history walk, draw-state memo keys, UNKNOWN-vs-DISPROVEN honesty all
  preserved verbatim.
- `search.py` + `engine.py`: expectimax over the model distribution
  (top-k truncated, renormalized) under an oracle-first, misère-safe
  root partition (no one-ply accident mate/stalemate/draw while an
  alternative exists).
- `evaluate.py`: the asymmetric CURRENT-profile core (root-as-loser
  at every leaf, mate-aware menu squeeze, executioner preservation,
  clock fear) minus all template machinery — steering owns that now.
- `league/`: the FROZEN LEAGUE. Dev families zach/sloppy/squat;
  held-out families sloppy-held/human-held/squat-held/random with
  parameters pinned in `models/presets.py` on 2026-07-21 — report
  against, never tune against. Fresh RNG and fresh engine per game
  (the old arena's shared-stream cascade caveat is retired), seats
  alternated, outcomes classified by taxonomy (forced vs mercy mate,
  accident wins, stalemates both ways, draw kinds), per-family rows
  plus worst-family billing. `--engine specialist` runs the frozen
  bot on the same scoreboard via a lazy wrapper (bridge's >=60s-tier
  budget clamps).

Selftest: 19/19 (oracle re-proves the organic FORCED_MATE fixture
adversarially at n=1 and the proof line's last ply IS the taxonomy's
forced case; the x-ray/pin greed poses port as distribution tests;
league smoke alternates seats end-to-end). Timing: ~0.2s/move at
depth 3 / topk 5 under PyPy — a 240-ply game in ~23s, a full 7x10
league in ~30-40 min serial.

Protocol from here: tuning and fitting touch dev families only;
held-out parameters move for mechanics bugs, never performance; every
progress claim cites the league report (JSON + PGNs under
games/league/), mean AND worst family; milestones 60/80/90% held-out
forced rate; the live bar stays "the corner poses and the mate lands
BY FORCE against a human."

### Baseline league (2026-07-21, re-pinned same day)

Pinned twice-over on the same day: the first pin (commit c1b4588) was
superseded by the review round (coverage-true chance nodes and
seed-paired seats change what runs mean), and the model table was
superseded once more by the process-stable subset seed (hash(None) is
id-derived on PyPy, so pre-fix containers modeled different reply
subsets from identical positions — the run wasn't reproducible). The
specialist table needed no third run: its path never touches the
subset seed. THESE are the tables of record (artifacts:
games/league/baseline-model/ and baseline-specialist/, report.json +
per-game PGNs). One lesson from the superseded runs stays: the 4
mercy mates `random` once handed the model engine vanished under a
different seed schedule — mercy-of-noise is luck, which is exactly
why the scoreboard separates it from forced.

MODEL ENGINE (belief=sloppy, depth 3, topk 6, coverage 0.85, probe

```

THE ANCHOR DREW FIRST BLOOD: squat-held game 2 (engine White) is the
specialist's first full-game forced selfmate ever recorded — every
prior conversion started from a hand-set endgame drill. The corner
construction poses organically (Kh1, g1 plug, g-pawn executioner
preserved through the squatter's greed), the rook strips the last
loose pawn, and 81.Qg5+ Kh3 82.Qf4 g2# closes a genuine zugzwang —
the exact shape of the standing live bar, landed against a held-out
kernel. PGN: baseline-specialist/squat-held_g02_selfmate-forced.pgn.
Two readings, both true: the corner machinery is real when the
opponent's king cooperates by temperament (a squatter walks into its
own pocket), and one family at 25% with every other held-out row at
zero is precisely the specialist's known shape — strength where the
opponent matches a modeled kernel, nothing where it doesn't.

AND THE MODEL ENGINE DREW BLOOD IN THE SAME PIN: zach game 5 (engine
Black) is the new stack's first forced selfmate ever — 72...Qf7+
73.gxf7#, the queen donated onto the square where the pawn capture is
the opponent's only legal reply and the recapture IS the mate. That
is the forced-recapture device, the same family as v0.3's historic
54.Qc2+ Kxc2# — rediscovered organically by oracle+steering with zero
construction machinery. PGN:
baseline-model/zach_g05_selfmate-forced.pgn. The two firsts are a
clean diagnostic pair: the anchor converts via the kernel-matched
zugzwang (corner squatter walks into its own pocket), the model via
the opponent-robust forcing device. Everything else decomposes as
before — greedy families end in stalemate-us/mutual-strip (competent
strip, no sustained conversion pressure), avoidant families wall at
max-plies, and held-out stays 0/40. The ladder is explicit now:
match the anchor's 1/16 held-out, then pass it — sub-root oracle
probes, selective steering depth, and league-legal endgame guidance
are the levers, then the corpus fit.

## Sub-root probes and the crossfire: first held-out blood (2026-07-21)

The session opened the named levers in order and the league graded
each honestly. What landed (commit e7c1f2d, selftest 24 -> 32
checks):

- SUB-ROOT PROBES: steering's our-nodes carry a budgeted oracle probe
  (n<=2, 30k/move sliced 8k/call, memo shared with the root probe —
  its keys were already position+clock+repetition+n+side complete).
  Two gates, either opens: opponent at <=5 non-king men, or our king
  in check.
- FLIGHT-SQUARE PRICING (evaluate.py): in the king+pawns regime,
  every open flight square around our king costs 24 — corner
  affinity, self-smothering, and their-coverage in one gradient.
- BARE-KING GUARD: the safety partition now refuses to strip the last
  mating man while alternatives exist.
- ROOT PROBE DEEPENED: n 3 -> 4 under cap 40k -> 50k; iterative
  deepening self-regulates (wide positions burn out early and answer
  UNKNOWN, narrow ones — where conversions live — reach n=4).

Dev evidence chain (games/league/dev-subprobe-r1/r2/r3, 10
games/family, baseline seeds): r1 (material gate <=3) produced the
session's first discovery — sloppy g01, the CROSSFIRE DEVICE:
37...Re8 baits the near-certain promotion, 38.a8=Q+ Rxa8+ 39.Qxa8# —
check, counter-check, forced recapture-mate. The model engine's
first forced selfmate against a greedy family, found by the leaf
zugzwang term through the belief's 95% promotion mass, at SIX
opponent men — invisible to the material gate (and to the oracle
gauge: the engine's final move was its only legal one, so no probe
ever ran). The r1 autopsies also caught the engine stripping zach to
a bare king and then donating a bishop to reset the draw clock over
the corpse — hence the guard. r2 isolated the widened gate cleanly:
IDENTICAL trajectories to r1, the probe confirming the crossfire
(sub=4/182) and proving nothing anywhere else (thousands of calls,
zero hits) — the certifier works; steering never assembles anything
for it to certify. r3 (guard + n=4) prevented the corpses without
changing a label. Cost: ~35-64s/game on strip-heavy families (~52
min full league).

```

FIRST HELD-OUT BLOOD: random g00 (engine White) is the model
engine's first held-out forced selfmate — and it is the corner
construction itself, assembled organically against UNIFORM NOISE.
The engine walks its king to h1 behind its own h2 pawn, preserves
random's h-pawn as the executioner the whole game, herds random's
king across the board with queen checks (Qa2/Qb2/Qc2 driving
Kc1-d1-e1-f1), promotes a second queen for tempo, and donates:
99.Qg2+ hxg2# — the forced-recapture finish on the FORCED_FIXTURE's
exact shell, closed under three root certificates (oracle=3). PGN:
subprobe-model/random_g00_selfmate-forced.pgn. Against mercy=1.0
there is no policy to exploit — the net held against every legal
reply, which is the robustness claim in its purest form. The two
random mercy mates in the same row are ledgered as luck, exactly as
the taxonomy intends. Against the baseline: held-out 0/40 -> 1/40
(2%), dev 1/30 -> 1/30 (the conversion relocated from zach's
recapture device to sloppy's crossfire), worst held-out 0% in both.
The anchor still leads on rate (1/16, 6%) — but the diagnostic pair
sharpened: the anchor converts the kernel-matched squatter and
nothing else; the model now converts the two families NO kernel ever
cracked (a greedy human, pure noise) and not the squatters. Strip
quality also moved: sloppy-held's draws shifted toward
insufficient-material 6/10 (clean strips, no conversion pressure)
and stalemate-us stayed rare (3/70 total).

The reading, for next session: certification is solved down to the
budget knobs — the root oracle plus sub-probes close whatever
steering reaches, and the gauges prove where nothing was reachable
(sub=0/N across 69 of 70 pinned games). The binding constraint is
ASSEMBLY: flat depth-3 steering does not construct nets, and the r2
null is the cleanest possible statement of it. Lever 2 stays the
named next move — selective deepening in stripped positions, which
needs value memoization to be affordable, which needs a decision
about draw-state honesty in a steering-only cache. The squat
near-miss (r1 g00: king frozen into pawn_last, pawns released to
promotion) is the concrete target shape.

### Artifact policy (2026-07-21)

Adopted with the subprobe merge: git keeps the citable minimum —
every forced-selfmate PGN (the trophies; four exist as of today) and
report.json for runs a log entry pins as a table of record. Draw
PGNs and dev-exploration runs (the dev-* directories above included)
stay on disk, out of git: the process-stable seed makes every run
regenerable bit-for-bit from the committed code plus the config its
report records, so bulk artifacts are redundant evidence. The two
baseline directories predate the policy and stay tracked as pushed.
